# PowerShellScripts
This is my repository for my PowerShell learning journey

The first file titles "azure_security_upload.ps1" is my code for uploading Windows Event login events to an Azure Blob Storage, and is part of a larger journery I'm on to understand Cribl pipelines for transferring and manipulating data

The azure_security_upload.ps1 was the first step, a way to upload some security events to Azure so I have some input for my Cribl pipeline.
